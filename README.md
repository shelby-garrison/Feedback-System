## ‚ö° Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- MongoDB (local or remote)
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)



### Backend Setup

#### Local Development
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Start MongoDB:**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running locally, or update `MONGO_URL` to point to your MongoDB instance.
3. **Run the backend server:**
    Navigate to backend directory:
   ```bash
    cd backend
   ```
    from the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
4. **Register a user:**
   - Use the `/api/register` endpoint to create your first user (manager or employee).

#### Run backend via Docker
1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   docker build -t feedback-backend .
   ```
2. **Run the container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 -e MONGO_URL="mongodb://host.docker.internal:27017/feedback_system" feedback-backend
   ```
   - On Windows/Mac, `host.docker.internal` lets Docker access your host's MongoDB.
   - Or link to a MongoDB container/network as needed.

### Frontend Setup

#### Local Development
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the frontend server:**
    Navigate to frontend directory
   ```bash
   > cd frontend
   ```
    from the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   > uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```
3. **Access the app:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8001`
